# ETF Analyzer

The ETF Analyzer Web Application is a financial tool that allows users to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF. The application provides insights into the daily and cumulative returns of individual assets within the ETF as well as the overall portfolio. By using advanced SQL queries, Python, and the Voil√† library, users can visualize and explore the performance data in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

The main problem this project addresses is the need for a comprehensive tool to analyze the performance of ETFs, particularly in the fintech sector. This web application enables users to assess the historical returns of different assets within the ETF, identify top-performing stocks, and evaluate the overall portfolio's performance. It empowers investors, financial professionals, and enthusiasts to make informed decisions based on data-driven analysis.
